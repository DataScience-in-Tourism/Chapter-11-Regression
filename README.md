### Abstract

Regression is the task of calculating a numerical value based on an object’s set of characteristics. One important sub-branch consists of methods that learn regression functions from example data. This repository provides a Jupyter notebook along with a data set from a tourism-related use case that exemplifies how to model the prediction of the total sum of bookings for a hotel based on web tracking data. Predictions with linear regression, support vector regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks will be calculated and evaluated.
